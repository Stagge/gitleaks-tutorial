Great work!ðŸ¥³ You are now ready to start harnessing the power of Gitleaks.

Youâ€™ve now gone from installing, configuring and running Gitleaks locally to automating secret detection through pre-commit hooks and CI/CD integration. With these steps in place, your repositories are far less likely to leak sensitive information, and even if mistakes happen theyâ€™ll be caught early.

While Gitleaks adds a small amount of time to your workflow (usually just a few seconds per scan), the security it provides more than makes up for it. A few extra seconds during commit or build time is a small price to pay to prevent an exposed API key from compromising your entire system.

Now get out there and start committing worry-free! ðŸŽ‰
